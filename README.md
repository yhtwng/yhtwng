- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @yhtwng. I'm a math student in cpge mpsi in France, Paris. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in math, art, [music](https://open.spotify.com/user/jaimelasalade) (tbh i'm a huge music enthusiast lol and i'm fond of arranging music [sheets](https://musescore.com/user/34542066), video games, and i'm (still) a beginner in coding. I'm also a movie-lover and I love watching the classics ones (but la boum will always have a special place in my heart ðŸ’—)!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and Ocaml at school and really want to progress, and learn more and more!
- ðŸ“« If you want to contact me (for any reason lol), I have an [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/yhtwng/) account (it used to be an art account, but sadly i do not have time to post anymore ðŸ˜”)
